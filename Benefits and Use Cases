Let's look at some of the benefits of integrating BigQuery and Gemini for structured and unstructured data analytics.

Bringing GenAI to your data: No more moving data around, duplication, and added complexity. You can analyze data and generate insights within the same BigQuery environment.
Enhanced analytics: Gemini's natural language explanations adds a new layer of understanding to your data and you can achieve this by using SQL queries.
Scalability: This solution handles large datasets and complex analysis with ease and low-code effort.
The applications for this are many. Consider scenarios in finance (market trend analysis), retail (customer sentiment), healthcare (medical report summaries), etc. where your analytics and business teams could implement these with relatively low effort, resources and a familiar language and tool of choice.
